    "# Grover's Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that finds a specific item in an *unsorted* list of *N* items with a quadratic speedup compared to classical search.  Instead of taking O(N) time (like a classical linear search), Grover's algorithm takes O(√N) time.  It achieves this by cleverly manipulating the amplitudes of the quantum states representing the items in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Oracle:**  A \"black box\" function that can recognize the item we're looking for.  In quantum terms, the oracle applies a negative phase to the state corresponding to the marked item.\n",
    "*   **Diffusion Operator (Inversion About the Mean):**  An operation that amplifies the amplitude of the state marked by the oracle, while decreasing the amplitudes of the other states.\n",
    "*   **Superposition:** The algorithm starts with a uniform superposition of all possible states (representing all items in the list).\n",
    "*   **Iteration:** The oracle and diffusion operator are applied repeatedly (approximately √N times) to increase the probability of measuring the marked item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Implement the Grover's oracle.\n",
    "2.  Implement the Grover diffusion operator.\n",
    "3.  Combine these to build the complete Grover's search algorithm.\n",
    "4.  Run the algorithm with an example.\n",
    "5. Visualize results"
