    "### **Shor's Algorithm**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This function combines both quantum and classical parts to find the factors of a number $N$.\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The algorithm begins by checking if $N$ is even. If so, it immediately adds $2$ as a factor.\n",
    "  - Next, it tries random values of $a$ and checks if they are coprime with $N$. If they are, the `order_finding` function is invoked to find the period $r$.\n",
    "  - If the period $r$ is even and satisfies certain conditions, the algorithm uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to compute the factors of $N$.\n",
    "  - This process is repeated until all factors are found or the maximum retry limit is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The QFT is applied to a quantum circuit to help identify the period of a modular exponentiation function.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: \n",
    "  - In Shor's algorithm, the QFT is used to transform a quantum state in such a way that the period of a function becomes visible in the measurement results.\n",
    "  - This operation is essential for extracting information about the period, which is later used to find the factors of the number being factored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Continued Fraction Approximation**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This function approximates the measurement result as a fraction and returns the denominator, which is related to the period found in the quantum part of the algorithm.\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - After performing quantum operations, the measurement result is a binary value. This function converts that value into a fraction.\n",
    "  - The denominator of this fraction is related to the period of the modular exponentiation function, which is central to Shor's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modular Exponentiation**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This function implements modular exponentiation, which calculates powers of a number modulo $N$.\n",
    "- **Explanation**: \n",
    "  - Modular exponentiation is crucial for Shor's algorithm because it generates quantum states that encode the powers of $a$ modulo $N$.\n",
    "  - This operation helps create a superposition of states, which is used in the subsequent Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to reveal the period of the modular function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Measurement**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This function measures the quantum state in all qubits and stores the result.\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - Once the quantum circuit has been executed (including the modular exponentiation and QFT), the quantum state is measured.\n",
    "  - The measurement collapses the quantum state into one of its possible outcomes, and the result is used to determine the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Order Finding**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This is the main quantum part of Shor's algorithm, where the period $r$ of a modular exponentiation function is found.\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - This function first checks if the number $a$ and $N$ are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors). If they are not, the algorithm can easily find a factor of $N$.\n",
    "  - If $a$ and $N$ are coprime, the function builds a quantum circuit that performs modular exponentiation and applies the QFT.\n",
    "  - After executing the quantum circuit and measuring the result, it uses continued fraction approximation to extract the period $r$, which is used to find factors of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overall Flow of the Algorithm**:\n",
    "1. **Initial Check**: If $N$ is even, the factor $2$ is added directly.\n",
    "2. **Quantum Circuit**: A quantum circuit is created to perform modular exponentiation and apply the QFT.\n",
    "3. **Measurement**: The quantum state is measured to reveal a value related to the period.\n",
    "4. **Classical Post-Processing**: After obtaining the period, classical techniques like GCD are used to extract the factors of $N$.\n",
    "5. **Factorization**: The algorithm continues to factor $N$ by trying random values of $a$ until all factors are found.\n"
