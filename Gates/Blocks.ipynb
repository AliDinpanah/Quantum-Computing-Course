    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. They provide a way to represent quantum algorithms using a sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits. This booklet explains the structure of quantum circuits, focusing on **blocks** and **modules**, which enable modular design and scalability in quantum algorithms.\n",

    "## What is a Quantum Circuit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **quantum circuit** is a graphical representation of a quantum computation. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qubits:** Represented as horizontal lines.\n",
    "- **Quantum Gates:** Represented as symbols on the lines.\n",
    "- **Measurement Operations:** Represented as meter symbols at the end of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|0⟩──H──●──M\n",
    "         │\n",
    "|0⟩────X──M\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit:\n",
    "1. Applies a Hadamard gate (`H`) to the first qubit.\n",
    "2. Applies a controlled-X gate (`●──X`) with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target.\n",
    "3. Measures both qubits.\n",

    "## Blocks in Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Block?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **block** is a reusable component of a quantum circuit that performs a specific function. Blocks are combinations of gates that can be applied multiple times in different parts of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Simplifies complex circuits by reusing defined blocks.\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Enhances readability and organization.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Facilitates the design of large-scale quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Entanglement Block\n",
    "\n",
    "An entanglement block creates entanglement between two qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|ψ⟩──H──●\n",
    "         │\n",
    "|0⟩────X\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block:\n",
    "1. Applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit.\n",
    "2. Applies a controlled-X gate to entangle the first and second qubits.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Modules in Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a higher-level abstraction that can include multiple blocks and gates. Modules represent a logical unit of computation and can be parameterized for flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Blocks and Modules\n",

    "| Scope              | Local, specific operation | High-level functionality  |\n",
    "| Flexibility        | Limited                   | Parameterized             |\n",

    "### Example: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Module\n",
    "\n",
    "A QFT module applies a series of gates to perform the Fourier transform on `n` qubits:\n",

    "|q₃⟩──────────────────H────────────M\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This module:\n",
    "1. Applies a Hadamard gate to each qubit.\n",
    "2. Applies controlled-phase gates (`●`) to encode phase information.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Quantum circuits consist of qubits, gates, and measurements.\n",
