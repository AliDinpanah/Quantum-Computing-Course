    "# Introduction to Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Qubits\n",
    "A **qubit** (short for quantum bit) is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either in the state \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\), a qubit can exist in a **superposition** of both states. This is mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- 0 and 1 are the **basis states** (analogous to classical states 0 and 1).\n",
    "- α and β are complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- Ψ is called the **state vector**, which describes the qubit's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences Between Classical Bits and Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature              | Classical Bit          | Qubit                             |\n",
    "|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n",
    "| **State**            | \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\)    | Superposition of 0 and 1 |\n",
    "| **Representation**   | Boolean (0 or 1)      | Quantum state Ψ  |\n",
    "| **Operations**       | Logical (AND, OR, NOT)| Quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard, Pauli-X) |\n",
    "| **Measurement**      | Deterministic         | Probabilistic                     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Quantum Properties:\n",
    "1. **Superposition**: A qubit can be in a combination of 0 and 1 states.\n",
    "2. **Entanglement**: Qubits can be correlated in ways that classical bits cannot.\n",
    "3. **Quantum Measurement**: The act of measuring a qubit collapses it to 0 or 1 with probabilities $$ |\\alpha|^2 \\text{ and } |\\beta|^2 $$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical Representation\n",
    "Qubits are not abstract; they are implemented using physical systems that exhibit quantum mechanical properties. Common implementations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Photons**:\n",
    "   - Qubits are encoded in the polarization states of photons:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     |H\\rangle \\text{ (horizontal polarization)}, \\quad |V\\rangle \\text{ (vertical polarization)}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Used in quantum communication and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Electrons**:\n",
    "   - The spin of an electron represents a qubit:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     |\\uparrow\\rangle \\text{ (spin up)}, \\quad |\\downarrow\\rangle \\text{ (spin down)}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Superconducting Circuits**:\n",
    "   - Superconducting loops with Josephson junctions are used to create qubits.\n",
    "   - Widely used in quantum computers built by companies like IBM and Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trapped Ions**:\n",
    "   - Individual ions are trapped using electromagnetic fields, and their electronic states act as qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quantum Dots**:\n",
    "   - Small semiconductor particles where the charge or spin state encodes the qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Qubits represent the foundation of quantum computing and quantum information theory. Their ability to exist in superposition, interact through entanglement, and be manipulated with quantum gates enables the powerful capabilities of quantum systems.\n"
