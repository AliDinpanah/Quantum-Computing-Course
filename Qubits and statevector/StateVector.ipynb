    "# State Vector Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basis States 0 and 1\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, the states 0 and 1 are called the **computational basis states**. They serve as the building blocks for describing the state of a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, these basis states can be represented as column vectors:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|0\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n",
    "|1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Any qubit state can be described as a **linear combination** (or superposition) of these basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Superposition Principle\n",
    "A qubit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1, which means it can be in a state that is a weighted combination of both basis states. The general form of a qubit state is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- α and β are complex numbers.\n",
    "- α^2 and β^2 represent the probabilities of measuring the qubit in 0 or 1, respectively.\n",
    "- The normalization condition ensures that the probabilities sum to 1:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\rangle $$, the probabilities of 0 and 1 are equal (\\( 50\\% \\) each).\n",
    "- If $$ |\\psi\\rangle = |0\\rangle , \\text{the state is fully in} |0\\rangle $$ with \\( 100\\% \\) probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation Using Dirac Notation\n",
    "In **Dirac notation**, quantum states are written as Ψ (called a **ket**) and are elements of a complex vector space. The dual of Ψ is Ψ called a **bra**), which represents the conjugate transpose of the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a state $$ |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle $$, the dual is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle\\psi| = \\alpha^* \\langle 0| + \\beta^* \\langle 1|,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where α^* and β^* are the complex conjugates of α and β, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product between two states Ψ and Ψ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i \\phi_i^* \\psi_i.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "## Bloch Sphere Visualization\n",
    "The **Bloch sphere** is a geometrical representation of a qubit's state. It provides an intuitive way to visualize the state of a single qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametrization of the State\n",
    "A general qubit state can also be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)|0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)|1\\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where: \n",
    " $$ \\theta \\text{ (polar angle) and } \\phi \\text{ (azimuthal angle) define the position of the state on the Bloch sphere.}$$ \n",
    " $$ \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\text{is the probability of measuring} |0\\rangle$$\n",
    " $$ \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\text{is the probability of measuring} |1\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bloch Sphere Features\n",
    "- The north pole θ = 0 represents 0.\n",
    "- The south pole θ = π represents 1.\n",
    "- Points on the equator θ = π/2 are equal superpositions of 0 and 1, with different relative phases determined by Φ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is described by the equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\quad y = \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\quad z = \\cos\\theta,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where \\( x, y, z \\) are the Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "On the Bloch sphere:\n",
    "- The \\( z \\)-axis represents the probabilities of 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-axes represent the phase relationships between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is a powerful tool for understanding single-qubit operations and visualizing the effects of quantum gates.\n"
