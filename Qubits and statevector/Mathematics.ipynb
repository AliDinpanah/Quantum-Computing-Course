    "### Complex Vector Spaces  \n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is represented as a vector in a **complex vector space**. A complex vector space is a set of vectors where both the vector components and the scalars used for multiplication can be complex numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a vector $|v\\rangle$ in a two-dimensional complex vector space can be written as:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} a + bi \\\\ c + di \\end{bmatrix},\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "where $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Corresponding Operation**:  \n",
    "- **Addition of Vectors**: $|v\\rangle + |w\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ b_1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} a_2 \\\\ b_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 + a_2 \\\\ b_1 + b_2 \\end{bmatrix}$.  \n",
    "- **Scalar Multiplication**: $c|v\\rangle = c \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} ca \\\\ cb \\end{bmatrix}$, where $c$ is a scalar.  \n",

    "### Linear Algebra Basics  \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is fundamental to quantum mechanics. Below are the core concepts and their corresponding operations:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectors and Matrices  \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors represent quantum states, while matrices represent operations on these states. For instance:  \n",
    "- A state $|v\\rangle$ in a two-dimensional space:  \n",
    "  $$|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}$$  \n",
    "- A matrix $M$ operating on $|v\\rangle$:  \n",
    "  $$M = \\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} \\end{bmatrix}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Corresponding Operation**:  \n",
    "- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:  \n",
    "  $$M|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} m_{11}a + m_{12}b \\\\ m_{21}a + m_{22}b \\end{bmatrix}.$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Product  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **inner product** of two vectors $|u\\rangle$ and $|v\\rangle$ is defined as:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle u|v \\rangle = \\sum_i u_i^* v_i,\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "where $u_i^*$ is the complex conjugate of the components of $|u\\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Corresponding Operation**:  \n",
    "- Compute the conjugate transpose of $|u\\rangle$ and multiply with $|v\\rangle$:  \n",
    "  $$\\langle u| = \\begin{bmatrix} a^* & b^* \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\langle u|v\\rangle = a^*c + b^*d.$$  \n",

    "### Unitary Transformations  \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $U$ is **unitary** if it satisfies:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "U^\\dagger U = I,\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "where $U^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $U$, and $I$ is the identity matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unitary transformations preserve the norm of quantum states, ensuring probabilities remain normalized. They represent quantum gates and time evolution in quantum mechanics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Corresponding Operation**:  \n",
    "- Apply the unitary matrix $U$ to a state $|\\psi\\rangle$:  \n",
    "  $$|\\psi'\\rangle = U|\\psi\\rangle.$$  \n",
    "- Check unitarity: $U^\\dagger U = I$.  \n",

    "\n",
    "An operator $H$ is **Hermitian** if:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "H^\\dagger = H.\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hermitian operators are important because they correspond to observable quantities in quantum mechanics (e.g., energy, position). Their eigenvalues are always real, which aligns with the physical requirement of measurable quantities being real numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Corresponding Operation**:  \n",
    "- Check Hermitian property: $H^\\dagger = H$.  \n",
    "- Apply $H$ to a state to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors:  \n",
    "  $$H|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle,$$  \n",
