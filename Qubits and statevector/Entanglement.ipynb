    "## Entanglement and Multi-Qubit Systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement is a unique quantum phenomenon that occurs when the state of one qubit becomes inseparably linked to the state of another, even across large distances. To understand entanglement and multi-qubit systems, we explore key concepts such as tensor products, Bell states, and quantum correlations.  \n",

    "### Tensor Product and Combined State Representation  \n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with multiple qubits, the combined state of the system is represented using the **tensor product** of individual qubit states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single-Qubit States  \n",
    "Suppose we have two qubits with the states:  \n",
    "- Qubit 1: $|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle$  \n",
    "- Qubit 2: $|\\psi_2\\rangle = \\gamma|0\\rangle + \\delta|1\\rangle$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The combined state of the two-qubit system is represented as:  \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\rangle \\otimes |\\psi_2\\rangle = (\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle) \\otimes (\\gamma|0\\rangle + \\delta|1\\rangle).\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the distributive property of the tensor product, this expands to:  \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "|\\Psi\\rangle = \\alpha\\gamma|00\\rangle + \\alpha\\delta|01\\rangle + \\beta\\gamma|10\\rangle + \\beta\\delta|11\\rangle,\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "where $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$ represent the basis states of the two-qubit system.  \n",

    "#### Corresponding Operation  \n",
    "For two vectors:  \n",
    "- $|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad |\\psi_2\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{bmatrix}$,  \n",
    "the tensor product is computed as:  \n",

    "### Bell States and Their Significance  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bell states** are specific examples of maximally entangled two-qubit states. They form an orthonormal basis for the two-qubit system and are given as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$  \n",
    "2. $|\\Phi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle - |11\\rangle)$  \n",

    "4. $|\\Psi^-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|01\\rangle - |10\\rangle)$  \n",

    "#### Properties of Bell States  \n",
    "- They are **entangled**, meaning the measurement of one qubit affects the other.  \n",
    "- Measurement outcomes are perfectly correlated or anti-correlated, depending on the Bell state.  \n",

    "#### Corresponding Operation  \n",
    "- To create a Bell state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ from two qubits initially in $|00\\rangle$:  \n",
    "  1. Apply a **Hadamard gate** to the first qubit:  \n",
    "     $$H|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle).$$  \n",
    "  2. Apply a **CNOT gate** with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target:  \n",
    "     $$CNOT\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle) \\otimes |0\\rangle\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle).$$  \n",

    "#### Definition of Entanglement  \n",
    "A multi-qubit state is **entangled** if it cannot be written as the tensor product of individual qubit states. For example:  \n",
    "- The state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$ is entangled because it cannot be separated into two independent single-qubit states.  \n",
    "- In contrast, $|\\psi\\rangle = (\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle) \\otimes (\\gamma|0\\rangle + \\delta|1\\rangle)$ is **separable**, as it is a tensor product of two states.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum Correlations  \n",
    "Entangled states exhibit quantum correlations, meaning the outcome of a measurement on one qubit is related to the outcome of the other, even if they are spatially separated. These correlations violate classical expectations, as described by **Bell's theorem**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corresponding Operation  \n",
    "- Measure each qubit in the Bell state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$:  \n",
    "  - If the first qubit is measured as $|0\\rangle$, the second qubit will also be $|0\\rangle$.  \n",
    "  - If the first qubit is measured as $|1\\rangle$, the second qubit will also be $|1\\rangle$.  \n",

    "### Key Takeaways  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **tensor product** combines the states of multiple qubits, forming a higher-dimensional state space.  \n",
    "2. **Bell states** are examples of maximally entangled states and are critical for quantum information tasks like teleportation and superdense coding.  \n",
    "3. **Entanglement** enables quantum correlations, forming the basis for phenomena that defy classical intuition, such as non-locality.  \n",
